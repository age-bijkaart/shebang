A program for use with the 'shebang' ('#!' at the beginning of the first line of a file) mechanism.
 
Usage: the program 'shebang' is only useful to process a 'shebang' file which looks as shown below:
 
  ----------------------------------
  #!/path/to/shebang program arg..
  rest
  of
  file
  ..
  ----------------------------------
 
where each arg is either 
- a word not starting with '$'
- a parameter of the form $D where D is in 0..9, $n refers to the n'th argument of the command
- the special 'filename' $< which refers to (the contents of) the rest of the file
 
The 'shebang' program processes a file as above, it copies the rest of the file in a temporary file
and then forks and execs 'program arg'.. where each arg corresponds to an argument mentioned in the
'shebang' line.

Thus it allows to run programs from 'shebang' files that do not process standard input in a standard
way or that need more arguments/options than 'env(1)' allows. 
An example is 'phantomjs http://phantomjs.org/:' which can now be run from a shebang file like this.
 
Name of the file below: http-grab

  ----------------------------------
  #!/path/to/shebang phantomjs $< $1
  .. js script that grabs the contents of a url 
  ----------------------------------

  ./http-grab url

will eventually execute
 
  phantomjs /tmp/$$ url

where /tmp/$$ refers to a temporary file containing all but the first line of the shebang file. Once
phantomjs is finished, /tmp/$$ will be deleted.
